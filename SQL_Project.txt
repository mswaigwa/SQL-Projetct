Business Question One:  
Find the employees who met the sales target of at least 100000, for the year 2008. 


/*Exploring the data*/

/*Join the two CTE's above */

SELECT P.*, S.* 
FROM Sales_Person P
JOIN Sales S
ON Sales_Rep_ID = Employee_ID






Business Question Two:  
Find the bottom 5 (least profitable products) that were launched into the market on or after '01-JAN-98'.


/*Exploring the data*/

SELECT * FROM SH.Products
SELECT * FROM SH.Profits

           FROM SH.Products)

the net profit of the bottom 5 selling products, that were lauched into the market after '01-JAN-98' */

FROM Profit P
JOIN Product PP
